# ERC20---FLUR-Token
This is an ERC20 smart contract i created. It has several contracts within it in order to save money. I've tested this contract and deployed it in order to assess its functionality. I used ganache accounts in order to run these test on Metamask. Enjoy!

This ERC20.sol contract has an abstract contract, ownership contract, and a contract called MyERC20 is ERC20_STD, Ownership which is the actual token i created.
